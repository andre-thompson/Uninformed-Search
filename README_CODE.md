**How long it takes to complete this assignment?**  
-Around 4-5 hours
**What is the most challenging part for you?**  
-The hardest part of this program was figuring out how to implement the 
prewritten code as well as the Iterative Deepening and Uniform Cost functions.  
**What do you learn from the visualization?**   
-Visualization allows us to see and compare various search functions at any given iteration during its execution. 
**Compare graph search and tree search and indicate the major difference between them.**  
-The major difference between graph search and tree search is the implementation of states. Only unique states are represented in tree search whereas graph search may contain multiple duplicate states.  
**In the code, what are the differences between implementing tree search and graph search?**    
-The biggest difference between implementing them is in the visualization functions.
